Matthew: April 3, 2019, an hour before midnight. It seems like this text is auto scrolling. Yay!
Imaginary Friend: It seems so, well done.
Matthew: Thanks, it took longer than I expected.
Imaginary Friend: At least you have it done.
Matthew: You want to hear a joke?
Imaginary Friend: Umm, sure?
Matthew: Knock knock.
Imaginary Friend: Oh god, a knock knock joke? I hear more of those than knocks in real life...
Matthew: Well, it was nice talking. Good night.
