Yew: Eres, Bastion, I managed to track a few rabbits, but I couldn’t line up a clean shot before they ran into their hole.
Eres: Hah, all I hear are excuses, Yew, you’ve always made excuses whenever you couldn’t reap any rabbits.
Yew: Well at least-
Bastion: Now, now, settle down you two.
Yew: Yes, sir
Eres: Okay, father
Bastion: It’s no surprise that there’s this many rabbits in Fuhr this summer. I’m sure they’re going to be harder to find as autumn comes closer.
Yew: Yeah, autumn...
Villager: Oh no! Help us!
Eres: What was that?
Yew: There are soldiers coming here!
Eres: Let’s go!
Soinge: I'll help!
