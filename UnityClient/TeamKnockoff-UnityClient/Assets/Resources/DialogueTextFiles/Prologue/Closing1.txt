Yew: I think that’s the last of them.
Eres: Yew, there’s soldiers coming!
Villagers: Help us please!
Bastion: Yew, Eres. What’cha doin holding yer weapons at a villager? What is it?
Eres: But I thought… sorry.
Villagers: Our town has been invaded, we were a small group who managed to escape and get help. You have to help us!
Yew: Just us?
Eres: We can’t just leave them, Yew!
Bastion: Soinge, what do you think? We’re just sheep without a shepherd if you don’t go.
Soinge: If it means to help more villagers, then I will go. It’s what I’ve been sent to do.
